Node.js project initialized with 'npm init -y' (-y for default values).
It created a package.json -file to keep track of dependencies.

For testing, Jest was installed with 'npm install jest'. This created a large folder
node_modules/ which will be gitignored.

package.json was updated with:
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node crossword.js",
    "test": "jest"
    "audits": "node run-audit.js"
  },

Dependencies (Jest) aren't included in repository. Install them with 'npm install'

run tests with 'npm test -- -silent'  (silent to skip console-log()'s)
